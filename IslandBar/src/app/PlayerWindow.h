// =====================================================================
//  PlayerWindow.h
//  The player that does not speak to the system: read from its own window title.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//
//  Everything the bar shows about music comes from the system media session
//  (Windows.Media.Control, SMTC): the title, the artist, the cover, the position and the
//  three transport keys. A player that never registers a session is therefore invisible
//  to the bar -- and there is one on this machine that behaves exactly like that: NetEase
//  Cloud Music 3.1.40 plays with the system's session list EMPTY, and only publishes a
//  session once its own switch is turned on (measured, with the session list at zero
//  while four of its processes were playing; see HANDOFF 8.72).
//
//  What such a player does say out loud is its window title: NetEase's window carries
//  `<song> - <artist>` while a track is up (measured: `长大以后你是否无忧 - 宋扬/不劉`),
//  and `island_bar.exe --lyrics-test "长大以后你是否无忧" "宋扬"` fetched 42 lines from
//  that pair in 406 ms. The words are the one thing the island cannot do without, and the
//  lyrics themselves come from the online lyric APIs by title and artist -- so the title
//  is enough for the line.
//
//  WHAT IT DOES NOT GIVE: the cover, the position, the playing/paused state and the
//  transport keys. So a track read this way drives the PILL'S LINE ONLY; the media card
//  is not offered for it (every field of that card comes from the session, and a card
//  built on a title would be a rectangle of empty rows with three dead buttons). The
//  lyric line is counted from the moment the title appeared, so it is aligned when the
//  bar catches the song as it starts and drifts when the bar is started mid-song. Both
//  of those are written down rather than papered over.
//
//  Read-only: it enumerates windows, reads their titles and the names of the processes
//  that own them. It injects nothing, sends nothing, and touches no player.
