// =====================================================================
//  BarState.h -- the bar's own state, in one place instead of scattered through the frame loop
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-10-15 every one of these values was a local at the top of RunBar -- a function
//  about 5,000 lines long. Nothing said which locals were STATE (they survive from frame to frame and belong
//  to the bar as a whole) and which were merely computed inside one frame; a reader had to infer it from how
//  far apart the uses were, and a writer could not see the whole picture before changing one of them.
//
//  THIS IS SLICE 1 OF THAT MIGRATION, NOT THE FINISHED THING. The tray card and its menu are here because
//  they are the area with the sharpest edges -- a menu that must not offer a row it cannot carry out, an armed
//  "end the application" entry, a learning pass that must not start twice -- and because one piece of that
//  state had already turned out to be owned by the wrong module (trayMenuRequestCell, see shell/TrayMenu.h).
//  The rest follows one named group at a time, each moved with a full rebuild and the self-test, so that a
//  mistake is always attributable to the group that just moved.
//
//  WHAT BELONGS HERE: state that outlives a frame and that more than one phase of the loop reads. What does
//  not: values computed inside a single frame (a rect, a flag that means "this frame drew something"), and
//  objects that own resources (the window, the renderer, the media session) -- those get their own named
//  group when their turn comes, because building them is a sequence rather than a set of fields.
