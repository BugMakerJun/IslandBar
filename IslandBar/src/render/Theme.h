// =====================================================================
//  Theme.h
//  The material, as data: the colours and edges the bar is drawn from, in a list the user can
//  switch between -- and can add to, by dropping a text file in `themes\`.
//
//  WHERE THIS CAME FROM. A review brief asked for "Liquid Glass": a translucent dark surface, a soft
//  highlight along the top, a hairline edge, no heavy borders -- and for the palette to be black,
//  deep blue and ice blue. Everything it asks for is drawing, and all of that drawing reads a handful
//  of colours, so the colours are one struct rather than a style pass: switching a theme re-colours
//  every surface at once and cannot leave two of them disagreeing.
//
//  WHAT A THEME DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CONTROL: whether the desktop behind the bar is BLURRED. That is
//  not a colour question -- it is whether this window can have a backdrop at all, and it is measured
//  in scripts/probe-glass-blur.ps1 (acrylic does blur behind the window, but across its whole
//  rectangle, so the window would have to be shaped to what is drawn first). A theme that claimed
//  "glass" while the backdrop stayed sharp would be the kind of half-truth this project avoids.
//
//  THE CONTRAST FLOOR IS PART OF THE FORMAT, not a note in a document: 'no over-transparency that
//  makes the text unreadable' is checked by ThemeInkContrast, and the self-test runs it over every
//  built-in theme. A user theme is loaded whatever it says -- it is the user's screen -- but the
//  number is in the log when it is below the floor.
