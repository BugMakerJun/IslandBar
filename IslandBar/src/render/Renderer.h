// at full contrast inside an outline that is still growing.
//

// dimmed to 35% and ramped back over 0.34 s. Reported as "点击系统按钮 或者 播放音乐的时候 鼠标移入灵动岛

// them, and on the way closed they leave together with the border they were sitting in.

// directions run their progress from 0 to 1 (the shape interpolates from `from_` to `to_`, and which of
// those is the card is the caller's knowledge, not this function's).
//
// The lead is a third of the movement: on the way open the card's content stays at its floor while the

// before the shape has finished a third of the way back. Both ends are exact -- 0.35 at the start of an
