// =====================================================================
//  GlassMaterial.h
//  The two layers of "glass" that are neither colour nor edge: the soft shadow under the shape and the
//  faint grain over it.
//
//  WHY A MODULE. The review brief this answers asks for a material built from layers -- blur, gradient,
//  noise, highlight, edge, shadow -- and the bar already has the gradient, the highlight and the edge
//  (they are what Theme.h tunes; the blur is measured as unavailable, see Theme.h and HANDOFF 8.91). The
//  two that were missing are here rather than inside the window or the renderer, because both are drawn
//  identically for the pill AND for every card, and one copy of "what a soft shadow is" is the same rule
//  the surfaces already follow.
//
//  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: any kind of CPU blur, screenshot, or GDI path. The brief forbids those
//  and this project does too -- everything below is Direct2D primitives on the GPU.
//
//  WHY IT LIVES IN render/ (2026-10-16): it is drawing -- Direct2D primitives for a surface -- and it
//  already depends on render/Theme.h for the constants it uses. It sat in platform/ for a while, and that
//  single include was the ONLY back edge in the layer graph (platform -> render while render -> platform),
//  which is what kept the layers from being locked with static libraries. See ARCHITECTURE.md section 7.

// THE LIGHTING A GLASS SURFACE GETS FROM THE ROOM: a highlight along the top, a shade along the bottom, and
// a hairline just inside the edge.
//
// ONE FUNCTION FOR THE PILL AND FOR EVERY CARD, which is the same rule the surfaces themselves follow: the
// bar and its cards cannot end up lit differently, and there is one place to change how the material
// behaves. Both gradients are filled over the SHAPE's own rounded rectangle, so they follow its curve --
// an inner line drawn as a plain rectangle pokes out at the rounded ends, which is the trap this avoids.
//
// One theme field drives all three (`theme.gloss`): light from above and dark from below are the same
// amount of lighting, and a theme that asks for no gloss gets a flat surface, as 默认 does.

// with no intermediate surface, no effect graph and no allocation. `spreadDip` is how far it reaches.
//
// It is not a Gaussian and does not claim to be: a real one needs an offscreen bitmap and a blur pass,
// and at the size of these shapes (a 36 DIP pill, a 280 DIP card) the stepped version is what the eye
// sees anyway. What it must not be is a hard edge, so the steps overlap rather than tile.

// edge, 1 = its right). PURE, so the self-test can assert the clamping rather than the drawing: a pointer
// at or past an edge must not push the highlight off the glass and leave a bright spot on the corner.
//
// The highlight travels across the INNER 80% of the width. That margin is the only number here, and it
