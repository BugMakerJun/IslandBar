// =====================================================================
//  ThumbnailPreview.h
//  A live thumbnail of a window, shown under the bar while the pointer rests
//  on that window's icon.
//
//  WHY A SECOND WINDOW. A DWM thumbnail is not a bitmap this program can
//  fetch: the compositor draws the source window INTO an HWND of ours, on its
//  own schedule. So the preview is a window of its own -- a topmost, never
//  activated, click-through popup placed under the bar -- and the bar's own
//  surface is not involved at all.
//
//  Click-through is deliberate. The preview is a reminder, not a control: the
//  icon above it is what opens the window, and the preview must not be able to
//  swallow a click meant for the desktop underneath or for the bar above.
//
//  Minimised windows have nothing to show (DWM renders them empty), which is
//  also what the shell's own taskbar does. Nothing here special-cases that.

// Pure, so its placement can be asserted without a compositor, a window list or a screenshot. The
// properties that matter are all statements about arithmetic: the picture keeps the source's aspect
// ratio, the card wraps it with its title row and margin, the card is centred under the icon it
// belongs to, it hangs below the bar, it never leaves the monitor, and it is never degenerate.

// `sourceWidthPx`/`sourceHeightPx` are what the COMPOSITOR reports for the source
// (DwmQueryThumbnailSourceSize), NOT the window's rectangle, and the difference is a defect this
// function used to have: it took the aspect from GetWindowRect, and the compositor stretches the
// thumbnail to fill the rectangle it is given -- so a window whose reported rectangle and whose
// thumbnail differed came out SQUASHED into a strip (a 1226x701 window drawn into a 260x44 box,
// reported from the user's own screen). The compositor's own answer cannot disagree with the
