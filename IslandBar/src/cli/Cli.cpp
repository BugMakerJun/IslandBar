// =====================================================================
//  Cli.cpp -- THE COMMANDS THAT RUN INSTEAD OF THE BAR
//
//  These twelve commands lived in main.cpp until 2026-10-15, mixed in with the frame loop, the assembly of
//  every subsystem, and the tray rules. They are not part of the bar: each one is a question the workflow
//  asks a build ("what does the shell's record hold", "is there anything to send to that icon", "did the
//  media session arrive"), and each one prints through core/Log.h and answers with an exit code.
//
//  THEY TOUCH EVERYTHING, ON PURPOSE. A command that asks about the tray still stands up a window and a
//  renderer to answer, because that is what "run the bar and ask it one question" means -- the alternative
//  would be a second implementation of the bar that could disagree with the real one. What they must not do
//  is grow into a second program: the argument parsing stays in main.cpp, which knows the flags.
//
//  THE ONES THE WORKFLOW DEPENDS ON are --tray-dump, --tray-surface, --tray-learn and --tray-press: they are
//  the contract a script can hold this program to (see ARCHITECTURE.md), and they are named in HANDOFF as the
//  way every tray measurement was taken.
//
//  Nothing here is new code: it is the same text, moved, with island:: added at the call sites.
