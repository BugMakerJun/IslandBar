// =====================================================================
//  TrayHook.cpp -- INSIDE THE APPLICATION, WHEN IT TELLS THE SHELL ABOUT ITS TRAY ICON
//
//  WHAT THIS IS FOR. Pressing a tray cell without moving the pointer means POSTING the application's own
//  callback message to its own tray window, and that needs three things about the icon: the window, the
//  message number and the uid. Until now the message number was learned by hand, one application at a time,
//  with a Win32k trace and a third-party program in the room (HANDOFF 8.104) -- which the user called out,
//  rightly, as a chore rather than a feature.
//
//  The way out is to be present when the application REGISTERS its icon, because the structure it passes to
//  the documented API carries every field needed. This module is that presence: the bar loads it into each
//  running tray application with SetWindowsHookEx(WH_GETMESSAGE) on that application's threads, and once it
//  is inside, it points the application's OWN import slots for Shell_NotifyIconW/A at the detour below. The
//  application then writes down its own answer the next time it registers -- which the bar asks for with the
//  standard TaskbarCreated broadcast, the same signal the shell sends when Explorer restarts.
//
//  WHY IMPORT TABLES AND NOT CODE PATCHING. Overwriting the first bytes of the shell's function would catch
//  one more case -- an application that resolves the address itself and calls through its own pointer, which
//  is what WeChat's Qt tray does (measured: 0 import slots, so it is not caught here) -- but it means copying
//  an unknown number of instruction bytes and putting them back somewhere, in a process that is not ours. An
//  import slot is a pointer in a table; if this module is wrong about it, the call still reaches the real
//  function. That is the trade this file makes deliberately, and the missed case is written down in
//  HANDOFF 8.107 rather than hidden.
//
//  WHAT IT WRITES: %USERPROFILE%\IslandBar\tray_learned.txt, one line per call. The bar reads that file,
//  resolves each window's class and turns the lines into its callback cache.
//
//  ASCII-only on purpose. Do not add non-ASCII text to this file.

//  THE SHELL'S OWN COPY OF A REGISTRATION -- HOW AN ICON IS LEARNED WITH NOBODY IN THE APPLICATION
// =====================================================================
//
//  An application tells the shell about its tray icon by SENDING a WM_COPYDATA to the window of class
//  "Shell_TrayWnd" (measured on this machine 2026-10-15: receiver class "Shell_TrayWnd" inside explorer, the
//  sender window equal to the tray window the payload names, dwData 1, cbData 1484). Because this module is
//  already mapped inside the shell process -- the bar offers it to Explorer for exactly this reason -- the
//  WH_CALLWNDPROC channel above sees that copy arrive, and the payload is marshalled into THIS process, so
//  every field of the registration can simply be read. Nothing has to be injected into the application.
//
//  That is the answer to the limitation this project kept hitting: an AppContainer application refuses the
//  hook (measured: SetWindowsHookEx returns 87 for ChatGPT.exe), and a self-protecting one accepts the hooks
//  and never loads the module (QQ Music). Their registrations still travel to the shell, and this is where
//  they are read. Measured in the first run of this code: ChatGPT.exe (AppContainer) registered uid 3,
//  message 0x8001, tip "ChatGPT", guid E5768D8B-6936-4F45-B1AD-4C5FB414CB35.
//
//  THE LAYOUT, read off the bytes rather than assumed. A controlled registration (probe-tray-registrar.exe:
//  uid 7, message 0xABCD, tip "ISLANDBAR-PROBE-4711", NIM_SETVERSION 4) and a cross-check against
//  applications whose answers the bar already had (Steam's copy names uid 1 with message 0x0401 and the tip
//  "Steam"; the GUID-registered icons carry exactly the guids the shell's own registry entries name) give:
//
//      +0x000  the shell's tag, 0x34753423, in every copy
//      +0x004  the NIM_ command: 0 ADD, 1 MODIFY, 2 DELETE, 4 SETVERSION
//      +0x008  956, in every copy
//      +0x00C  hWnd   -- the application's tray window (4 bytes; handles fit, so the shell stores one DWORD)
//      +0x010  uID
//      +0x014  uFlags  (0x20 is NIF_GUID: the icon is identified by guid, not by uid)
//      +0x018  uCallbackMessage
//      +0x01C  hIcon
//      +0x020  szTip, wide, 128 characters
//      +0x328  uVersion -- non-zero only in the NIM_SETVERSION copy (the union with uTimeout, so a
//              registration that never says reads 0 -- see HANDOFF 8.111)

    // ---- PIN THIS MODULE IN THIS PROCESS, BEFORE THE FIRST SLOT IS TOUCHED ---------------------------------
    //
    // This is the fix for the crash this module shipped on 2026-10-15, and the reason it is first rather
    // than best-effort.
    //
    // What happened: the bar unhooked and freed this module at the end of its learning window, the loader
    // then unloaded the copy inside each application, and the import slots this walk had redirected kept
    // pointing at the detour's address -- in a page that no longer belonged to anything. The next time the
    // application called Shell_NotifyIcon it jumped into freed memory. Measured in the Application log:
    // Explorer.EXE six times, wallpaper64.exe four times, module `island_tray_hook.dll_unloaded`, exception
    // 0xc0000005 / 0xc000041d, fault offset 0x10a0 -- the detour's own entry point.
    //
    // GET_MODULE_HANDLE_EX_FLAG_PIN makes the loader ignore every later FreeLibrary for this module, for the
    // life of this process. The slot therefore always points at code that is still mapped, whether the hook
    // has been removed or the bar has exited. The cost is honest and has to be stated: the file this module
    // was loaded from stays locked until the application restarts, which is why the bar stages it under a
    // content-stamped name (see TrayLearn.cpp) instead of loading `island_tray_hook.dll` directly.
    //
    // If the pin FAILS the walk does not run at all: a redirected slot that can be unloaded again is exactly
    // the state that crashed those applications, and "not watching this application" is the safe answer.
