//  What is playing right now, read from the system media controls.
//
//  Windows exposes this through Windows.Media.Control (the same session the
//  volume flyout shows): SMTC. It works for anything that registers a media
//  session -- Spotify, browsers, the new Media Player, WeChat's player -- without
//  any per-app work, which is why it is the right source here.
//
//  Threading: every WinRT call is made from a worker thread, never the UI thread.
//  The session manager is an async API whose first call waits on the shell; doing
//  that on the frame loop would stutter the animation, and an unresponsive media
//  provider must not be able to freeze the bar. The UI reads a snapshot.

// anything time-based built on the raw snapshot moves in steps: the card's progress bar jumped, and
// the lyric line changed a couple of seconds after the words were sung ("现在歌词和唱的有点对应不上").
// Projecting the reading forward by the elapsed time is the same correction in both places, so it is
// one function rather than two copies of the arithmetic.
//
// Not projected when it cannot be trusted: paused (the position is not advancing), a live stream with
// no duration, or a session that reports zero (which is what "this application does not report a
// position" looks like). Clamped to the duration, because a projection that runs past the end of the
// track would park the last line for as long as the pause before the next one is noticed.

// `StartTime 00:00`, `EndTime 00:00` for the whole song. Both of the things built on the position
// then sat still: the lyric line is chosen by it, so the pill stayed on the first line ("歌词不动"),

//
//   * the session's own reading, projected forward between its polls, when it publishes a timeline;
//   * otherwise a STOPWATCH the bar runs itself (see TrackPosition::fromSession), which is the same
//     accounting the window-title source needs (PlayerWindow.h).
//
// The stopwatch is advanced by the caller, and only while the song is playing -- so pausing leaves
// the words where they are, which is the rule the projected path already has.
//
// THE HONEST LIMIT: a stopwatch knows how long the track has been ON SCREEN, not how far into the
// song it is. A bar started mid-song therefore begins the words at the first line and drifts until
// the next track; catching a track as it starts is aligned. Said here, in the handover, and in the

// kSkipPollIntervalMs instead -- which also brings the new cover and the new lyrics in at the same speed.
