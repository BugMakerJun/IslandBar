//  Motion.h
//  The island's three states and the interpolation between them.
//
//  This file owns two things and nothing else:
//    * the target geometry of each state, and
//    * how far a transition has progressed, and what that looks like.
//
//  It deliberately does NOT own the clock, the window or the renderer. The
//  animation is a pure function of elapsed time, which is what makes it testable
//  without a screen: given a start box, a target box and a duration, Tick() must
//  produce a specific box.
//
//  Design rule carried over from phase 0-d: the window is never resized. Every
//  state change moves the pill's own width, height and corner radius inside a
//  window that stays exactly as it was created. Resizing a composition
//  swap-chain window flickers, so the window is a fixed stage and the pill is
//  the actor.

//
//   * Expanded, which is a card and grows downward;
//   * FullBar, which fills the band a full-screen application leaves.
//
// Everything else is the pill. What changes between those states is the CONTENT -- the clock, or a
// lyric -- and what responds to the pointer is the row of icons beside it. A bar whose outline jitters
// as the pointer crosses it is the thing this removes, and it also removes a whole class of collision:
// a wider island grew symmetrically, so its left edge reached towards the Start button.

// Hover is the resting shape with the application icons WIDENED so each one can say what it is.
//
// It is no longer a full-width taskbar. The first version of this grew the island into a
// screen-spanning strip and put the icons inside it, which is not a Dynamic Island and not what was
// asked for: the request was that opening an application adds an icon BESIDE the island, with the
// island staying where it is. So the island keeps its geometry and the row of icons is what
// changes.
//
// The width is the island, the padding, a full row of the WIDE buttons, and a margin -- fixed,
// because a strip that changed size as windows opened and closed would make the whole bar appear to
// jump. TaskStripLayout.h derives the buttons; the two are asserted to agree.
// The pointer being on the bar does NOT change the island's size.
//
// It used to: Hover was 1040 wide, because the first design had no permanent icon row and the island
// had to spread to make room for a taskbar inside itself. Then the icons moved out to sit BESIDE the
// island, and the widening was left behind -- so hovering produced a 1040 DIP pill with a clock at one
// end and 1000 DIP of nothing, with the icons drawn outside it (measured: island ended at 1799, first
// icon started at 1807). Reported, with a screenshot, as "this is what it looks like when the pointer
// is on it".
//
// The row is what responds to the pointer now: the icon under it widens to show its title, and the
// island keeps its shape. So this is the resting size, and the state remains only because the pointer
// being on the bar is still a distinct condition the policy tracks.

// only DOWNWARD.
//
// It was 400, narrower than the 520 strip, so the first ~100 ms of "opening" actually pulled
// the sides IN while the bottom dropped -- a visible inward twitch, reported as a stutter on
// hover entry. A shape that is opening must not get narrower anywhere. Matching the strip's
// width also gives the card the room its text wanted.
inline constexpr float kExpandedWidthDip   = 520.0f;
// 232 DIP, up from the original 132.
//
// The music card is laid out like the Windows 11 media flyout, which needs an app row, an
// 80 DIP cover with two lines of text beside it, a row of times, a progress bar and a row of
// controls. 132 DIP could hold the cover or the text, not both. The window is 240 DIP tall,
// so this still fits inside it with the pill's top margin to spare -- and the window is never
// resized, which is what makes that constraint load-bearing.
// 250 DIP.
//
// Both cards are the SAME state and therefore the same shape: two heights for "the card" would mean the
// bar was tall while showing music and short while showing system state, and the outline would jump
// between them for no reason the user could see. So this is the taller of the two requirements.
//
// THE MUSIC CARD IS WHAT SETS IT, and the reason is not obvious. Its content band is a FRACTION of the
// card's height (0.52 to 0.94) rather than a fixed inset from the top, so shrinking the card moves the
// time row UP faster than it moves the artwork -- the band itself gets shorter from the top while the
// 44 DIP cover keeps its size. Measured:
//
//     h 232   artwork [48, 140]   elapsed [144, 160]   fits
//     h 220   artwork [52, 148]   elapsed [138, 154]   overlaps by 10
//     h 212   artwork [56, 156]   elapsed [132, 148]   overlaps by 24
//
// so the reduction to 212 that the system panel wanted was not available. The panel's arithmetic was
// right and its conclusion was wrong: it asked for less height, and the card cannot give it.
//
// The ceiling is the window: the card starts at the pill's margin of 6, so 250 ends at 256 inside a
// never-resized 240 DIP window. THE WINDOW THEREFORE GROWS TO 260, which is the one number here that
// is free -- nothing is drawn below the card, and the window is a transparent strip over the desktop.
//
// 280, not 250: THE BRIGHTNESS ROW.
//
// The system panel gained a brightness slider under the volume row (22 DIP of track plus the 8 DIP gap),
// and the tile grid above it takes the space that is left -- so at 250 the six tiles lost 30 DIP between
// them and their glyph boxes were squeezed to about 8 DIP: measured arithmetic, not a guess, since the
// caption and its gap are 23 of every tile's height. Growing the card by exactly the row's height keeps
// the tiles the size they were designed at, and the window grows with it (Geometry.h: 320 -> 360).

// from the pill's 36 DIP up to the card's 250 -- but the panel is only 250 tall when the box is 250.
// Taking the clip from the box height directly therefore left 36 DIP of the panel on screen at BOTH ends
// of the movement, and the last quarter of the retraction was a band of tile tops hanging under the bar
// that did not move at all and then vanished in a single frame. Reported, with a screenshot of exactly
// that band, as "when I press to put it away it stops for a moment and then disappears".
//
// Zero means nothing of the card is showing, and the caller must SKIP the draw rather than clip to

// would be composed at full size, which is the opposite of hiding it.

//
// The user's decision settles it in a way that removes the whole class of problem rather than tuning a
// number: "the island does not need to grow sideways any more -- take that animation out". So the
// island's outline is now the SAME SHAPE in every state that is not the card, the full-screen bar, or the

// pushes the row further right, and with seven applications open the row already reaches most of the way to
// the monitor's edge. 420 leaves room for the row on a 2560-wide screen and still shows a full sentence of

// rectangle must not make the row jerk as the pointer moves between them, and a row measured from the CARD
// would swing 150 DIP sideways for the length of every card animation.
//
// The notice strip is the exception, and it is recognised by its SHAPE rather than by its name, because its
// own animation has to be followed: the strip grows 220 -> 420 DIP, so most of its frames are a shape that
// is neither the pill nor the strip, and a test written against the state's NAME would make the fill and
// the row jump at both ends of that growth (see the notice-strip assertions in Diagnostics.cpp).
//
// WHICH SHAPE, exactly -- the height, and only the height. Written first as "wider than the pill, narrower
// than a card, and shorter than half a card", and that rule has a hole big enough to drive the whole bar
// through: A CARD HALF WAY THROUGH ITS OWN GROWTH SATISFIES EVERY CLAUSE OF IT.
//
// The card's box is a lerp from the pill to 520x250, so for the whole first 40% of an opening -- and the
// last 40% of a retraction -- it is wider than the pill, narrower than a card, and under 125 DIP tall. The
// anchor followed it, and with the anchor the island's own FILL, the clock, the deck, the icon row, the
// window region and every hit test: a dark slab grew out of the pill and across the system panel's tiles
// with the time floating in the middle of it, the application icons slid 150 DIP right and back, and the
// anchor snapped home on the frame the box passed 125 DIP. Reported as "现在点击系统按钮会出现这种问题"
// with a screenshot of exactly that slab, and guessed at the time -- correctly -- to be the notice strip's
// doing, because this rule is what the strip added.
//
// The pill's own height is the discriminator: a strip keeps it for the whole of its growth (the strip's
// height IS the pill's -- see SettledSizeFor), while a card's morph leaves it on its first frame. The card
// and the full-screen bar stay excluded, as before, by width and by height.
//
// The trade-off this leaves: a transition that MORPHS between the strip and a card (the panel opening while
// a message is up, or a message arriving while the panel is open) puts the anchor back on the resting pill
// at its first frame, so the fill snaps from 420 wide to 220 instead of lerping. One frame's jump in a rare
// transition, against a growing slab in every card animation.
