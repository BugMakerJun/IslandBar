// =====================================================================
//  StatePolicy.h
//  What the pointer means for the island's shape.
//
//  This is the rule that decides, once the motion has settled, which shape the island
//  should be in given where the pointer is. It lives here, as a pure function, for two
//  reasons:
//
//   * It is the rule that broke. The promotion from hover to the details card was
//     written inside the branch that LOWERS an already-open card, so nothing ever moved
//     Hover -> Expanded. Every geometry assertion still passed, because the card's
//     rectangle was perfectly reachable -- the state machine simply never asked for it.
//     The symptom was "the pointer goes in and no card appears", with music playing so
//     the resting shape was the lyric strip rather than the plain pill.
//
//   * A test that reproduces a rule instead of calling it proves nothing. The first
//     version of that regression test copied this logic into Diagnostics.cpp, and
//     passing against the broken build is exactly what it did. The rule has to have one
//     home, and the test has to call the same one the frame loop does.
//
//  Deliberately free of window, renderer and Win32 types: it is a function of four
//  values, so it can be exercised for every combination cheaply.
