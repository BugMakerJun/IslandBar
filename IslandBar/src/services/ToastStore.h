// =====================================================================
//  ToastStore.h
//  The SECOND notification channel: Windows' own toast store.
//
//  The push channel (a named pipe) is for things on this machine that want
//  to tell the bar something. This one is for everything else: a message that
//  Windows itself is showing in the corner -- WeChat, a build tool, an installer.
//  It reads the same database the shell's notification centre does:
//
//      %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Notifications\wpndatabase.db
//
//  TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT DATABASE, both measured rather than assumed:
//
//   * It is SQLite, and Windows SHIPS THE ENGINE: `winsqlite3.dll` (3.51.1 here) exports the ordinary
//     sqlite3 API. So this file binds to it at runtime and the project does not vendor a 9 MB amalgamation,
//     does not need a network at configure time, and still works on a machine where the DLL is missing --
//     the channel is simply unavailable, which is reported rather than fatal.
//
//   * The payload column is a plain UTF-8 toast XML document with no binary prefix (checked against a real
//     row: it starts at `3C 74 6F 61 73 74` = "<toast"). The sender's identity is NOT in it -- it is in
//     `NotificationHandler.PrimaryId`, an AppUserModelID like "OpenAI.Codex_2p2nqsd0c76g0!App".
//
//  The reader OPENS THE LIVE DATABASE read-only and tolerates it being busy: the same file is held by the
//  notification service, and a reader that insisted on a lock would see an empty channel on every machine
//  where notifications happen. If the read-only open is refused it falls back to a copy under %TEMP%.
