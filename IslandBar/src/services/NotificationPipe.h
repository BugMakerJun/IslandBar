//  The local push channel: a named pipe the bar listens on.
//
//  Protocol, in full:
//
//      request  := uint32 length (little endian) | `length` bytes of UTF-8 JSON
//      response := same framing, a UTF-8 JSON object
//
//  A length prefix rather than newline framing, because a message body may
//  legitimately contain newlines and splitting on them would truncate it.
//
//  Why a named pipe and not a socket: it is the Windows-native mechanism, it needs
//  no firewall exception, and its default security descriptor already restricts it
//  to the local machine. The bar is a desktop shell component; it should not be
//  listening on a network port unless someone asks for that.
