// =====================================================================
//  IslandWindow.h
//  The host window for the bar, and the owner of the island's state.
//
//  Design decisions locked in, with the reason each one exists:
//
//  * WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP + DirectComposition. The window owns no
//    redirection surface; the GPU composes the swap chain straight to the
//    screen, so there is no per-frame CPU copy.
//  * The window is created once at its final size and is NEVER resized.
//    Resizing a composition swap-chain window flickers. Every state change moves
//    the pill inside this fixed window instead.
//  * WS_EX_NOACTIVATE + WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW, and WM_MOUSEACTIVATE answers
//    MA_NOACTIVATE, so hovering or clicking the bar never steals focus and it
//    stays out of Alt-Tab.
//  * Region-level click-through. At rest the window carries WS_EX_TRANSPARENT so
//    clicks land on whatever is underneath; the style is dropped only while the
//    pointer is inside the pill, and WM_NCHITTEST re-checks with the same
//    rounded-rectangle predicate the renderer draws with.
//
//  Events are reported rather than handled: the window records that the pointer
//  entered, left or clicked, and the message loop drains those flags after
//  pumping. Deciding what a click means is policy and does not belong in a
//  window procedure.
