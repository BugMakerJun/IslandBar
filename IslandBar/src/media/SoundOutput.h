// =====================================================================
//  SoundOutput.h
//  What the "声音输出" page needs: the output devices, and the per-application
//  volumes.
//
//  Two of the page's three sections come from here:
//
//   * 输出设备 -- every ACTIVE render endpoint, with its friendly name and whether it is the one the
//     system is playing through. Enumerated from IMMDeviceEnumerator, the same source the shell's own
//     flyout reads.
//
//   * 音量合成器 -- one row per application with an audio session on the default device, each with its
//     own volume (IAudioSessionManager2 -> ISimpleAudioVolume). This is the section that can be READ AND
//     WRITTEN with documented interfaces, and it is the reason this class exists.
//
//  ... and one thing about it does not: switching the DEFAULT device has no documented interface. The
//  shell does it through IPolicyConfig, which is neither documented nor in any SDK header; it is declared
//  by hand in the .cpp, used if the object answers for it, and reported honestly when it does not. A page
//  that listed the devices and pretended to switch between them would be worse than one that says so.
//
//  THE WORKER. Enumeration touches the audio service and the disk (an application's icon comes out of its
//  executable), and either can block for tens of milliseconds while the audio stack wakes up. That is
//  exactly what the stutter reports were about, so the reading happens on a worker thread and the frame
//  loop only ever copies a finished snapshot -- the same arrangement AudioVolume already uses for the
//  master volume, and for the same reason.
