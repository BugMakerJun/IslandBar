// =====================================================================
//  TrayLearn.h
//  Learning every application's tray callback, automatically, by being inside it when it registers.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS. A press is invisible only when it is the application's own callback posted to its own
//  tray window, and that needs the window, the message number and the uid. The message number cannot be
//  looked up (the shell's registry entry has uid, path, tooltip and picture, and no callback message) and it
//  cannot be observed from outside (the shell delivers it without a queue anyone else can read), so it used
//  to be learned by hand: a Win32k trace, an administrator prompt, and a third-party program clicking the
//  icon as the reference (HANDOFF 8.104). The user's verdict on that was correct: one application at a time
//  is not a mechanism.
//
//  What is a mechanism is being present when the application calls Shell_NotifyIcon: the structure it passes
//  carries the window, the uid, the callback message and the version. src/trayhook/TrayHook.cpp is that
//  presence -- a small module loaded into each running tray application with a thread hook -- and this file
//  is the driver that loads it, asks every application to register again (the standard TaskbarCreated
//  broadcast), reads what came back and merges it into the cache TrayPress already reads:
//
//      %USERPROFILE%\IslandBar\tray_callbacks.txt
//
//  AND THE MODULE STAYS BEHIND. It pins itself in each application it enters (see TrayHook.cpp) and its
//  import slot stays redirected, so the report keeps growing with every registration for the rest of the
//  session -- an application restarted from its own menu, an icon that only appears while a game runs. That
//  is what `HarvestLearnedCallbacks` is for: the bar calls it on its tray-refresh timer and picks those up
//  without installing anything again. The installing pass is only needed for applications this bar has not
//  reached yet, which is what `UncoveredApplications` reports.
//
//  WHAT IT CANNOT REACH, measured on this machine rather than assumed (HANDOFF 8.107): applications that
//  resolve Shell_NotifyIcon themselves and call through their own pointer (WeChat's Qt tray: 0 import
//  slots), applications that refuse an injected module outright (QQ Music), elevated ones (Task Manager is
//  High integrity) and packaged ones (ChatGPT is an AppContainer, where SetWindowsHookEx is refused with
//  error 87). Those keep whatever they had -- a hand-learned line, or the real click.

//
// An application does not keep its tray registration to itself -- it SENDS it to the window of class
// "Shell_TrayWnd" as a WM_COPYDATA, so a module inside that window's process reads every registration on the
// machine. That is what replaced the earlier pass that offered the module to each tray application in turn,
// and it is why the tray no longer has to be taught one application at a time. Measured 2026-10-15: an
// AppContainer application (ChatGPT.exe) and a self-protecting one (QQ Music, which accepts 98 thread hooks
// and never loads the module) both arrive this way, because both of them register through the shell.
//
// A GLOBAL hook was tried on 2026-10-15 and withdrawn the same day: with it installed Clash Verge's window
// came up black. Measured both ways -- `island running` gave 6 WebView2 processes and a client area of mean
// brightness 0, `island closed` gave 12 and brightness 56 with the UI rendered. Chromium refuses a pending
// injection of an UNSIGNED module into its renderer processes (RendererCodeIntegrity), and MyDockFinder's own
// DLL is a signed commercial binary, which is why one global hook works for it and not for this build. The
// shell's process is one process, so nothing has to be global. See TrayLearn.cpp.

// drains, which is why the ledger is kept and read from here.
