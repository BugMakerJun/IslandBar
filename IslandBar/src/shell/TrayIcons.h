//  TrayIcons.h
//  The system tray's application icons, for the right-hand end of the bar.
//
//  WHERE THE ICONS COME FROM, and why not from the tray itself.
//
//  The classic way to read the notification area -- walk Shell_TrayWnd down to
//  ToolbarWindow32 and read the buttons out of Explorer's memory -- is dead on
//  Windows 11 (measured on build 26220: that subtree does not exist; the tray is
//  not a toolbar any more).
//
//  What IS available, measured with scripts/probe-tray-uia.ps1:
//
//    * the shell publishes the tray through UI Automation -- names, rectangles and
//      an Invoke pattern, so the icons can be SEEN and PRESSED -- but only while the
//      taskbar is visible, and this bar hides it. That makes UIA the way to press a
//      tray icon, and not the way to draw one.
//    * the icons themselves are in the registry, one subkey per icon, with a PNG of
//      the image:
//
//          HKCU\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings\<hash>
//              ExecutablePath  the application that registered it
//              IconSnapshot    a PNG, 400-2300 bytes (magic 89 50 4E 47)
//              InitialTooltip  what the application calls it (often empty)
//              IsPromoted      1 = the shell shows it in the tray proper
//
//  So the images come from the registry, which needs no taskbar and no Explorer, and
//  the JSON is not involved at all.
//
//  WHICH ONES ARE SHOWN, and why "the application is running" turned out not to be the
//  answer.
//
//  The registry keeps an entry for every application that has EVER put an icon in the
//  tray -- that alone is a graveyard of old installs -- and the first filter over it was
//  "is the executable that subkey names running". That is a different question from "is
//  there an icon in the tray", and on this machine it is visibly the wrong one
//  (MEASURED 2026-10-16): thirteen cells against the shell's nine, the surplus being
//  three NVIDIA entries (NVDisplay.Container.exe is a process that runs all day and
//  registered nothing in that session) and one dead explorer GUID whose stored picture is
//  a blank 210-byte PNG.
//
//  So the filter is the shell's own answer: an entry is drawn while -- and only while --
//  one of the registrations the module watched arrive at Shell_TrayWnd names it
//  (shell/TrayLearn.h keeps that ledger, domain/TrayLedger.h holds the rule). When the
//  ledger is empty -- no module in the shell yet, or a shell that was just replaced -- the
//  card falls back to "the executable is running" and says so in the log, because a bar
//  that draws nothing while it cannot see the tray is worse than one that draws a cell it
//  is not yet sure about.
//
//  AND WHAT EACH ONE *IS*, for pressing it. The same registry entry the icon is drawn from carries the
//  identity the shell itself uses for that icon -- an IconGuid, or a UID belonging to one of the
//  application's windows -- and Shell_NotifyIconGetRect answers WHERE the icon is from that identity
//  alone. That is what makes a click in the card possible without matching names: the shell's own name
//  for an icon is the application's runtime tooltip (" 微信"), while the bar's is the registry's
//  ("Weixin.exe"), and no amount of string work reconciles the two. See TrayPress.
