// =====================================================================
//  Weather.h
//  One reading for one city: the temperature and the sky, in the words the
//  status strip prints.
//
//  WHY IT EXISTS. The island's own line is the clock when the bar is idle, and
//  something else -- the lyric, a message -- when it is not. So for as long as
//  music plays or a message is up, the bar shows no time at all, and the request
//  was that the date, the weekday, the time and the weather move into the empty
//  band to the left of the system button while that is the case.
//
//  WHERE THE POSITION COMES FROM, and the order is deliberate:
//
//   1. a line in %USERPROFILE%\IslandBar\weather.txt -- an explicit choice by the
//      user, so it wins outright. Either a city name or "lat,lon"; the file is
//      described at ReadSettings.
//   2. WINDOWS' OWN LOCATION SERVICE, when the file says nothing. This is the
//      primary source, asked for in as many words ("天气的能不能调用定位 而不是根据
//      ip"): Windows uses WiFi access points and satellites, and on this machine
//      it answers with the right city to 187 m.
//   3. nothing, which is reported with a reason and retried.
//
//  AN IP LOOKUP IS DELIBERATELY NOT USED, and the measurement is why: the keyless
//  IP services answer "Tokyo" on this machine while its clock runs on
//  Asia/Shanghai, because the traffic leaves through a proxy. Wrong weather at the
//  right time is worse than no weather.
//
//  FROM COORDINATES TO A READING is two HTTPS GETs to Open-Meteo, both keyless: the
//  forecast API takes coordinates and answers the current block as CSV, and a city
//  name (the file's other form) goes through Open-Meteo's geocoder first. CSV so
//  the numbers arrive on a line of their own and no JSON reader is needed for them.
//
//  NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE FRAME. The fetch runs on a worker and the frame loop
//  only reads the last published reading -- the same split the lyrics take, and
//  for the same reason: a slow or unreachable service must not be able to stall
//  the animation. A reading that has stopped being refreshed is still shown,
//  which is what a weather widget does.
