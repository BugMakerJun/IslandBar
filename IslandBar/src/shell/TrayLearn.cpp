//
//  Four steps, and the third one is the only interesting one:
//
//      1. offer the hook module to every running tray application (one thread hook per thread);
//      2. ask every application to register its icon again -- TaskbarCreated;
//      3. read what the module wrote down, resolve each window's class, merge into the cache;
//      4. report coverage: how many of the card's icons can now be pressed without a real click.
//
//  THE REPORT IS A FILE, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut. The module runs inside someone
//  else's process, in one process per application, and a file append is the one channel that needs no
//  protocol, no lifetime agreement and no extra process -- and it survives the module being unable to ask us
//  anything. It is truncated at the start of every run, so it never grows without bound.
//
//  ASCII-only on purpose. Do not add non-ASCII text to this file.

// THE COPY OF THE MODULE THAT IS ACTUALLY OFFERED TO APPLICATIONS, NAMED AFTER ITS OWN CONTENTS.
//
// The module PINS itself inside every application it enters (see TrayHook.cpp), because the alternative
// shipped a crash: it used to be unloaded at the end of the learning window while the applications' import
// slots still pointed at it, and Explorer and wallpaper64.exe died of it on 2026-10-15. A pinned module --
// and, more simply, a loaded DLL file -- cannot be deleted or overwritten while any process has it, so the
// build's own `island_tray_hook.dll` must never be the file that gets loaded: replacing it would fail until
// every hooked application on the machine had restarted, which for Explorer means a reboot.
//
// So the bar stages a copy under a name derived from the module's CONTENT (`island_tray_hook-<fnv64>.dll`)
// and loads that. Rebuilding with a change produces a new name, which no lock can refuse; rebuilding
// without a change reuses the same file; and an older copy taken over by a newer one (the import walk
// accepts any `island_tray_hook*` pile, see TrayHook.cpp) stops being called even though it stays mapped
// in the applications that already had it.
//
// Copies that are no longer the current one are deleted here, and a copy that is still mapped somewhere
// simply refuses to be deleted -- which is the same information as "some application is still running the
// previous build", and costs nothing.
// WHETHER THIS PROCESS ALREADY HOLDS THE MODULE -- a different question from "did it load during this pass",
// and the one that matters now.
//
// The module PINS itself in every application it enters (see TrayHook.cpp), so an application reached by an
// earlier session, or by the startup pass ten seconds ago, keeps it for the rest of ITS life and keeps
// reporting every registration through it. The report file is truncated at the start of every pass, so such
// an application writes nothing during a later one -- and the log line then said "the module loaded in 0"
// about a machine where three applications were being watched the whole time. A number that reads like a
// failure while the mechanism is working is worse than no number at all.
// Whether THIS staged build is already mapped in that process.
//
// IT USED TO ASK "IS ANY island_tray_hook* IN THERE", AND THAT WAS WRONG THE MOMENT THE MODULE CHANGED.
// The staged file is named after its content hash (StageHookModule), so a new build is never blocked by a
// file lock -- but the question asked here was about the NAME PREFIX, so a process still holding yesterday's
// module was counted as "already watching" and the new build was never offered to it. Measured on 2026-10-15:
// after deploying a module whose only change was which messages it observes, `--tray-learn` reported
// "the module loaded in 0 of them and was ALREADY watching 3 more" -- Explorer among them, still running the
// old copy, which is why the experiment produced no data at all. Comparing the staged file's own name makes
// an upgrade take effect in the processes that are still running, which is the point of staging by hash.

// a fresh pass every time a new application appears, and it has to be told to try again with a TaskbarCreated
// broadcast. It also -- measured, 2026-10-15, and written up in HANDOFF 8.109 -- is what left Explorer and
// wallpaper64.exe with import slots pointing at an unloaded module.
//
// What MyDockFinder does (HANDOFF 8.103, measured from its own binaries): `Dockmod.exe` calls
// `SetWindowsHookExA` and its `dockmod64.dll` is then mapped in the shell AND in a list of applications,
// including ones started later. ONE hook, installed once, and the operating system does the delivery to every
// GUI process that pumps messages -- which is exactly the coverage this project has been trying to assemble
// application by application.
//
// So: installed once at startup from the bar's main thread, never removed while the bar lives, and the module
// pins itself in each process it lands in (TrayHook.cpp), so an application keeps reporting every later
// registration even after the bar exits.
