// =====================================================================
//  SystemStatus.h
//  The state of the machine: network, Bluetooth, volume, power.
//
//  WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE, PURE LAYER
//
//  Every value here comes from a different Windows API with its own failure modes, and most
//  of them are CONDITIONAL rather than absent:
//
//    * the WLAN interface state is always readable, but the SSID and signal strength only
//      exist while connected -- asking for them otherwise returns an error, not "disconnected";
//    * the Bluetooth radio enumerates even when it is switched off;
//    * the battery APIs SUCCEED on a desktop and report "unknown", which must not be drawn as
//      0% or as a missing icon;
//    * the WLAN radio on/off state is not exposed at all on this build (measured: the query
//      succeeds and reports zero PHYs), so anything drawn from it would be invented.
//
//  So the API calls live in one place and produce a plain struct, and every DECISION about
//  what that struct means -- which icon, which strength, whether to draw anything at all --
//  is a pure function that can be asserted. "The icon is wrong" and "the API returned
//  something unexpected" are then two different investigations.
