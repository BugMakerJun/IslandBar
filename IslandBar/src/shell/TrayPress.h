// =====================================================================
//  TrayPress.h
//  Pressing one of the tray icons for the user, from the bar's tray card.
//
//  WHAT A PRESS IS NOW (2026-10-15): the application's OWN callback message, delivered to the application's
//  OWN tray window. Nothing is clicked, nothing is injected, and the user's pointer is never moved -- which is
//  the whole requirement, in the user's words: "把真实点击这个去掉不要 … 我就想要 MyDockFinder 一样的效果".
//
//  THIS FILE USED TO MOVE THE POINTER, and the history is worth exactly one paragraph because it is why the
//  route that replaced it can be trusted. Earlier rounds established that a real click on the shell's tray
//  icon is the only thing the shell forwards to an application, and that a UI Automation Invoke on the same
//  button is accepted and then ignored by the application (measured three times; the log line that would have
//  said so was itself broken for one round, which is a lesson this project has now learned twice). So the
//  press was a real click: pointer moved onto the shell's icon, button down and up, pointer restored.
//
//  What ended it: with the module of src/trayhook inside the application, watching what the SHELL itself sends
//  when a tray icon is really pressed, the answer turned out to be two SENT messages -- `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` then
//  `WM_LBUTTONUP` with the icon's uid in wParam (HANDOFF 8.109). Reproducing that pair, synchronously,
//  restores and activates the application's window with the pointer untouched. The same values POSTED had
//  produced nothing at all, in eight shapes, which is why this took as long as it did.
//
//  WHAT A PRESS NEEDS: the application's callback message number, the window to send it to, and the uid --
//  learned automatically by being inside the application when it registers (see shell/TrayLearn.h, and the
//  cache file it keeps). An application that has never been learned has no entry, and a press reports that
//  instead of doing something to the user's pointer: `NoEntry`. The card answers such a cell with its OWN
//  menu, which is where the "open it for me" actions live.
//
//  WHAT IS GONE, and may not come back without a measurement that says the messages cannot work:
//
//    * the real click: `SetCursorPos`, `SendInput`, the shell's overflow panel being made hit-testable for a
//      moment, and the alpha-1 reveal that went with it;
//    * the whole UI Automation route: `Shell_NotifyIconGetRect`, `IUIAutomationElement`, `Invoke`, the
//      `TrayStage` state machine that made the shell's taskbar exist-but-invisible for the length of a press,
//      and the watchdog that put it back afterwards;
//    * `ISLANDBAR_TRAY_PRESS_VISIBLE` and `ISLANDBAR_TRAY_NO_CLICK`, the two switches that existed to look at
//      the old route.
