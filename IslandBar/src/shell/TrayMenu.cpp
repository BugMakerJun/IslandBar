// =====================================================================
//  TrayMenu.cpp -- WHAT A TRAY CELL DOES, AND WHAT ITS RIGHT-CLICK MENU OFFERS
//
//  These functions used to live inside main.cpp's anonymous namespace, next to the frame loop, the
//  command-line handlers and the composition wiring. They belong to the tray: they say what a cell means
//  (press it, or draw the menu the bar offers for it), and they are called from exactly two places -- the
//  frame loop when a cell is clicked, and the --tray-* commands when one is pressed from a script.
//
//  WHY THE MOVE. main.cpp is where the program is ASSEMBLED, and a reader had to walk past 1,300 lines of
//  command-line handlers and 230 lines of tray-menu rules to find the frame loop. The rule this file is
//  built on is the one the menu states in its own comment: an entry is offered only if it can actually do
//  something, and the two entries that need a learned callback are dropped when there is none -- measured
//  on the user's machine, where pressing 应用自己的菜单… on an unlearned cell could only re-open the same
//  menu, which read as "nothing happened".
//
//  Nothing here is new code: it is the same text, moved, with island:: qualification added at the call sites.
