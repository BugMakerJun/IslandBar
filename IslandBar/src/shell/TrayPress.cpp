// ---- the posted-callback route, learned once per application (2026-10-15 late) ------------------------
//
// MEASURED, and this is the whole reason it exists: an application's tray icon can be pressed WITHOUT
// touching the pointer, by posting the application's own callback message to its own tray window. On WeChat
// that put its tray menu -- 退出微信 and all -- at the coordinates this bar passed, with the pointer sitting
// still, and nothing injected anywhere (HANDOFF 8.104; the screenshot is captures/wx-A1.png).
//
// THE LAYOUT IS THE PART THAT COSTS (NOTIFYICONDATA.uCallbackMessage):
//
//   v4 (modern):  LOWORD(lParam) = the notification, HIWORD(lParam) = the icon's uid,
//                 and the ANCHOR POINT is in wParam (low word x, high word y).
//   v3 (older):   wParam = uid, lParam = the mouse message -- WM_LBUTTONUP for a left click, WM_RBUTTONUP
//                 for a right one. NOT NIN_SELECT: measured 2026-10-15, posting NIN_SELECT to clash-verge
//                 and to Steam (neither ever calls NIM_SETVERSION, so both are v3) was delivered, was
//                 dequeued by the application, and produced nothing at all, while the shell's own click on
//                 the very same icon opens the window -- because the shell sends the mouse message. The
//                 silence was then read as "this application ignores its callback" and written into the
//                 cache, which is a verdict that may only be given to a correct message.
//
// The first two attempts used the v3-looking spelling with coordinates bolted into lParam's high word; both
// were delivered, both were retrieved by the application, and both were ignored. This is not guessable.
//
// WHAT IS CACHED, AND WHY A FILE. Per application: the message number, the class of the window it has to be
// posted to, and the icon's uid. The message number cannot be looked up anywhere (the shell's registry entry
// carries UID, IconGuid, path, tooltip and icon, and no callback message) and cannot be observed from this

    //
    //   v4  the anchor point is in wParam (low word x, high word y), and lParam carries the notification in
    //       its low word and the icon's uid in its high word;
    //   v3  wParam is the uid and lParam is the raw mouse message.
    //
    // AND THE DELIVERY IS PART OF THE SPELLING, which is the half that was measured rather than reasoned.
    // Watching from INSIDE clash-verge -- our own module is pinned in it, see the observation block in
    // TrayHook.cpp -- what the shell sends when that tray icon is really pressed is TWO MESSAGES, SENT and
    // not posted:
    //
    //     msg 0x1772 wparam 0x00000002 lparam 0x00000201   WM_LBUTTONDOWN
    //     msg 0x1772 wparam 0x00000002 lparam 0x00000202   WM_LBUTTONUP

    // Posted, those same values did nothing in eight different shapes (both packings, with and without the
    // DOWN, up only, double click) -- and the application's window was MINIMISED for those tests, so an
    // effect would have been unmistakable. Sent, the pair brought the window back and to the front with the
    // pointer untouched. A left press is therefore a SEQUENCE, not a message, and it must be synchronous.
    //
    // A v4 application is the same problem in a different shape: the documented notification for a single
    // left click is NIN_SELECT, and no v4 tray icon was running on this machine while the above was
    // measured. Rather than guess, a press tries the documented spelling first and the measured pair second,
    // and whichever produced an answer is written into the cache (`select` / `downup`, the seventh field),
    // after which it is a single delivery again. The first wait is short because an application that reacts
    // at all does so in about a tenth of that (measured: 78-93 ms for a menu), and a press nobody answered
