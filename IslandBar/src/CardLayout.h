// EXIT, which is where a per-frame answer goes wrong:
//
//   * CLOSING while the tray page is up switched the content on the first frame of the retraction: the
//     panel's tiles appeared where the grid had been and then shrank away. Reported as "点击展开 再点击收
//     回去 会显示出系统卡片的东西". The same thing happened closing from 声音输出.
//
// and in two more places that want the same answer: where the card STANDS (it hangs under the button that
// opened it -- the tray button is at the island's right, the system button at its left, 296 DIP apart, so
// the tray page's card was under the wrong end of the bar: "点击托盘按钮 弹出的卡片不在这个按钮下面") and
// whether the tray grid is what the pointer is over.
//

// the card is still wanted -- the 声音输出 page's Back control is a request to go back to the tiles with
// the card still up, and it has to be obeyed -- and only the retraction holds:
//
//   * card gone                       -> nothing is showing; the next open decides afresh
//   * the panel has been put away     -> keep the level the card was opened with, for the whole exit

//   * neither page asked, card up     -> the tiles (that is the Back control, and the panel's own button)
//
// `held` is the previous answer, so the caller feeds this back to itself exactly as it does with
