// =====================================================================
//  NativeTaskbar.h
//  Hides and restores the Windows shell taskbar.
//
//  This is the first thing the project does that affects the rest of the
//  desktop, so it is built around one rule: whatever is hidden must come back.
//  Hiding is idempotent, restoring is idempotent, and the state actually found is
//  remembered rather than assumed -- if the taskbar was already hidden when the
//  bar started (by the user, by an auto-hide setting, or by a previous crashed
//  run) then restoring must not fight that choice.
//
//  THREE MODES, and the middle one is the default since 2026-10-15:
//
//    * KEEP THE REAL TRAY (the default): the taskbar is not hidden but CLIPPED to the notification
//      area, so the system tray itself -- the shell's own icons, its own menus, its own overflow, the
//      clock -- stays on screen and every click on it is the real thing. Measured on this build:
//      the region survives icon changes, clicks in the clipped part fall through to the desktop, and
//      the tray keeps working. See HANDOFF 8.133 for the three experiments behind it (a same-named
//      window cannot take over the tray; the tray window cannot be moved -- its pixels are painted by
//      a composition surface belonging to the whole taskbar; clipping the taskbar works).
//    * HIDE IT (`--hide-taskbar`): the original behaviour, for comparing the two and for a desktop
//      with no room for the tray.
//    * LEAVE IT ALONE (`--keep-taskbar`): the debug mode, where the real taskbar is the taskbar.
