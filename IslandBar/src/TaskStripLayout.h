// =====================================================================

//  The island, the two buttons on its left, and the row of application
//  icons on its right.
//
//  The bar has one shape and three things anchored to it:
//
//      [ system ][ Start ]   island   [ icon ] [ icon ] [ icon ] ...
//
//  The SYSTEM button is leftmost and the Start button is between it and the
//  island. Both sit immediately against the island's left edge rather than out
//  at the window's margin, so the cluster reads as part of the island: the
//  island is the bar, and these are the controls attached to it.
//
//  The system indicators used to live here too -- up to four of them, out at the
//  window's left margin. They were removed: the request was that the deck hold
//  the Start and system buttons and nothing else, and a volume or battery glyph
//  beside a Start button says less than the panel behind the system button
//  already says. Their reader, their drawing and their hit test went with them
//  rather than being left as dead code.
//
//  The island does not move. That is deliberate and it is the point of the
//  design: an island that shifted sideways every time an application was opened
//  would be worse than useless. The icon row grows to the right from a fixed
//  left edge, so the island is a fixed point and the icons are what change.
//
//  Everything here is arithmetic over a rectangle, so it is tested directly
//  rather than by looking at a screenshot.

// constant speed and stops dead. A spring does the one thing a ramp cannot: it settles, with a little
// residual motion, which is what the eye reads as weight.

// opens by 102, which is visible as a settle and not as a bounce. The hit tests share this value (they
// always have: one amount drives the width and the push-along), so an overshoot of a pixel and a half is
// also the largest disagreement between what is drawn and what is clicked, for one frame.

// integration of a 26 rad/s spring overshoots the overshoot and rings forever, and the frame time on this
