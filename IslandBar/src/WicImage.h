//  WicImage.h
//  Decoding and re-encoding images through Windows Imaging Component.
//
//  Two jobs, both about album art:
//
//   * Shrink what SMTC hands us. The thumbnail stream is whatever the media app
//     published -- often several hundred kilobytes of full-size JPEG -- while the
//     card draws it at 96 DIP. Re-encoding once to a small PNG (a few tens of KB)
//     and holding that keeps the poll thread's memory flat and makes the per-frame
//     cost a decode of something already tiny.
//
//   * Turn bytes into pixels the renderer can use. Direct2D wants BGRA with
//     premultiplied alpha, and it cannot decode a PNG itself, so the decoder
//     lives here rather than in the renderer.
//
//  Everything here is a pure function of its inputs, so the self-test can run it
//  over hand-made bytes: a valid PNG, a truncated one, and garbage.

// application's icon. They used to share ONE buffer, so the last decode silently overwrote the first --
// and the card drew its cover out of the blurred background's bytes. The blur is smaller than the cover,
// so only the cover's first half was overwritten: the top came out smeared and the bottom still looked
// like album art. Reported in exactly those words: "歌曲封面这个上半部分会涂抹".
