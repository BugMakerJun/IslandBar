//  StartApps.h
//  The applications a self-drawn Start card can offer, and the ones the user pinned himself.
//
//  WHERE THE LIST COMES FROM. Not from the Start menu's own storage: the pinned order of the shell's
//  Start lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_*\LocalState\start2.bin`,
//  and that file is opaque -- measured: 13,276 bytes, and a UTF-16 scan of the whole thing finds no
//  application id at all (every run of "text" is noise). So the shell's pinned order is NOT readable.
//
//  What IS readable is the list underneath it, and it is the same list the shell builds its "all apps"
//  view from: the virtual folder `shell:AppsFolder`. Measured on this machine: 121 items -- 89 Win32
//  shortcuts and 32 packaged applications -- with LOCALISED names (微信, 记事本, 便签) and a "path" in one
//  of three shapes:
//
//      C:\SOFTWARE\QQMusic\QQMusic.exe                            a file
//      {1AC14E77-...}\cleanmgr.exe                                a shell folder item
//      Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App           a packaged application
//
//  and all three launch through one call, `ShellExecute(L"shell:AppsFolder\\" + target)`.
//
//  Reading the whole list costs about 600 ms, which is why it happens off the UI thread and only when it
//  is asked for.
//
//  THE PINS ARE OURS, AND THEY ARE A FOLDER OF SHORTCUTS. Since the shell's pinned list cannot be read,
//  this card keeps its own -- and the user, after the first version of that lost his pins, said how he
//  wanted it kept: "要不你创建一个文件夹 然后在里面放快捷方式 这样每次都还在 但是这个文件夹 可以修改位置".
//
//  WHY THE FIRST VERSION LOST THEM, because the reason is why this is a folder and not a file: the pins
//  were a text file of targets, and loading it VALIDATED every line against the shell's application list.
//  That list is filled by a worker and takes about 600 ms -- measured in the log, the lookup ran 300 ms
//  BEFORE it arrived, so all thirteen pins were rejected as "not in shell:AppsFolder" and the card came up
//  empty. A folder of shortcuts cannot fail that way: the folder IS the record, nothing has to agree with
//  it, and a shortcut is a thing the user can copy, rename, reorder (by name) or throw away in Explorer.
//
//  WHERE IT IS. `start_folder.txt` beside the bar, one line, comment lines allowed -- written out with the
//  default the first time, so the answer to "where do I change this" is in the file itself. The default is
//  `<the bar's folder>\Start`.
//
//  WHAT A SHORTCUT CARRIES. The AppsFolder item's own ID list, which is how the shell's Start menu makes
//  its own shortcuts, plus the AppUserModelID for a packaged application (the property the taskbar pins
//  by). That is what makes one call -- ShellExecute on the .lnk -- launch any of the three shapes.
