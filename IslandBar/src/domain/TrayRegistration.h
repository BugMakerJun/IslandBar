// =====================================================================
//  TrayRegistration.h -- WHAT AN APPLICATION SENDS THE SHELL WHEN IT REGISTERS A TRAY ICON
//
//  This is the wire format, in one place and with no Windows in it, for two reasons: the module that reads it
//  lives inside OTHER processes (src/trayhook) and the self-test has to be able to check the reading against
//  real bytes without a shell, a tray or an application anywhere in the room.
//
//  HOW THE LAYOUT WAS ESTABLISHED. Not by reading a header: `Shell_NotifyIcon` sends the shell a WM_COPYDATA
//  whose payload is the shell's own copy of the registration, and its fields were found by making a
//  REGISTRATION WITH KNOWN VALUES and looking for them in the bytes -- probe-tray-registrar.exe registers uid
//  7, message 0xABCD, tip "ISLANDBAR-PROBE-4711" and then NIM_SETVERSION 4, and the offsets below are where
//  those values appeared. Everything was then cross-checked against answers the bar already had: Steam's copy
//  names uid 1 with message 0x0401 and the tip "Steam", and the GUID-registered icons carry exactly the guids
//  the shell's own registry entries name. The raw captures are in reviews/tray-copydata-dump.txt.
//
//  WHAT THIS IS NOT: a stable ABI. It is the layout of ONE Windows build as measured on 2026-10-15 (Windows 11,
//  10.0.26220). The tag is checked, the size is checked, and a payload that does not match is REJECTED rather
//  than read at these offsets -- because the alternative is a bar that quietly learns wrong message numbers
//  from a format it never understood. If a future build moves a field, the right outcome is "no entries
//  learned", which is visible, and not "entries learned from the wrong bytes", which is not.
