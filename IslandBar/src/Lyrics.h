// =====================================================================
//  Lyrics.h
//  Song lyrics: fetch, parse, and answer "what line is playing now".
//
//  Source: the NetEase Cloud Music public web API, which is the usual choice for
//  this and needs no key. Two steps -- search for the track to get its id, then ask
//  for that id's lyrics, which come back as an LRC document.
//
//  Two things this deliberately does NOT do:
//
//   * touch the network on the UI thread. Fetching runs on a worker and the frame
//     loop only reads a snapshot, for the same reason the media poll does: a slow or
//     unreachable server must not be able to stall the animation.
//   * assume the service is available. A track with no lyrics, a search that finds
//     nothing, a timeout, or a changed response format all end in "no lyrics", and
//     the bar falls back to showing the track name. That is a normal outcome, not an
//     error to surface.

// height, so they never overlap, and the pill's one-line window is what reveals them -- which is why the
// two half rows are visible for the length of the roll and are BY DESIGN.
//
// THE FADE WAS TRIED AND PUT BACK THE SAME DAY. 8.31 replaced this with a cross-fade in place, on the
// strength of "是歌词不要换行" (a photograph of two half rows of "na na na" mid-roll), and the numbers said
// it did what it claimed: the ink never left one row. The user asked for the roll back before the day was
// out -- "还是改回去吧" -- so the roll is what this is, and the two slivers are the price of it. Any
// transition with a VERTICAL offset has them; only a fade with none can avoid them.
//
// A line that simply APPEARS reads as a jump -- the words change and nothing else does, which is what
// "现在感觉没有动画" described. The roll is short and it ends, so the loop goes back to sleep.

// a song whose lyrics it had already received. Reported as "现在音乐歌词 是怎么获取的" after lyrics
// that never appeared.
