// =====================================================================
//  WeChatWatch.h
//  "微信 · 有新消息" -- the third notification channel, and the one that had
//  to be built by watching a WINDOW rather than by reading a message.
//
//  WHY IT IS DONE THIS WAY, all of it measured on this machine (2026-10-11):
//
//   * WeChat 4.x ("Weixin", Qt + a self-drawn MMUI surface) is NOT registered as a
//     Windows toast sender: it is absent from HKCU\...\Notifications\Settings, it has
//     never written a row to wpndatabase.db, and it does not raise a tray balloon. The
//     bar's other two notification channels can therefore never see it.
//   * Its window exposes UI Automation DOWN TO A SINGLE SELF-DRAWN PANE
//     (`MMUIRenderSubWindow`): there is no chat name and no message text to read.
//   * What it does do is SHOW A POPUP of its own when a message arrives -- and that is
//     the signal this file uses. The user's decision was to keep it simple: the bar says
//     "微信 · 有新消息", not who said what. (Reading the text would mean photographing the
//     popup and running Windows' OCR over it; the engine and a Chinese recogniser are
//     both present, so that remains an option, but it is not what was asked for.)
//
//  NOTHING HERE TOUCHES WECHAT'S DATA OR ITS PROCESS. It enumerates windows, which is
//  public, and it never reads, injects into, or subclasses anything of theirs.

namespace island {

// Whether a window is WeChat announcing a message, judged from what a window can be asked.
//
// PURE, and that is the point: the whole feature hangs off this decision, and a wrong answer is
// invisible -- a window that was not recognised produces exactly the same screen as a message that
// never arrived. So it is a function of values, asserted in the self-test against the windows this
// machine actually has (the main window, the call window, the tray window, the 0x0 message windows)
// as well as against a synthetic corner popup.
//
// The rules, and why each one is there:
//   * VISIBLE -- a hidden window is not a notification.
//   * A TOAST-SIZED RECTANGLE. WeChat's own windows are either the 400x700+ main window or 0x0
//     message-only windows; a notification is a few hundred DIP across and about a hundred tall.
//   * NOT A WINDOW THAT IS ALWAYS THERE. The rule used to require the popup to be near a screen edge, on
//     the theory that a toast lives in a corner. That was WRONG, and the log proved it: when a message
//     arrived, no window appeared at all -- and the client does own a hidden 176x199 window sitting dead
//     centre, which is exactly the shape a compact "new message" card has. A hidden window's rectangle is
//     whatever its layout last computed, not where it will be shown, so judging position was judging a
//     number that means nothing until the window is on screen.
//   * NOT ONE OF THE CLASSES THAT ARE KNOWN NOT TO BE IT -- the tray icon's message window is
//     full-screen sized and hidden in practice, but it is excluded by name so the rule does not
//     depend on that staying true.

// Whether a window is WeChat's AUDIO/VIDEO CALL window -- the other thing the user asked the island to
// show ("微信通话 也应该在灵动岛 上").
//
// Judged by the title, because this window HAS one: `微信音视频通话` (with a trailing space, which is what
// the client actually sets). The notification popup has no title at all, which is the other half of why
// these are two separate rules rather than one "is this WeChat doing something" test.

// This is the last signal WeChat gives and the one the user asked for in as many words ("不需要读微信信息里有什么
// 就是来微信的时候有个通知就行"). Measured facts behind the rule:
//
//   * WeChat keeps an audio session open from the moment it starts, so the session EXISTING says nothing;
//   * `AudioSessionStateActive` means audio is flowing, so the moment it BECOMES active a sound has started;
//   * a notification plays a sound because "新消息通知声音" is on, so a sound with nobody talking is a message.
//
// The state is a level, not an event, so this is an EDGE detector and is pure: the failure it guards against is
// announcing on every frame of a sound that is still playing, and announcing again the instant the cooldown
// expires while the same sound continues.
